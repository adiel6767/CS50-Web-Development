# Welcome!

Hello to anyone reading this README file.

The main purpose of this repository is to guide individuals through my journey to become a full-stack developer.

My intention here is to master both React and Django technologies to create more and more complex web applications. As I progress through this journey, I will be documenting my learning experiences, sharing resources, and showcasing the projects I build along the way.

## About Me

I am Adiel Rodr√≠guez, a passionate individual with a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of web development. Originally, my background lies in geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where I worked on mapping and spatial analysis projects. However, I discovered my passion for web development and decided to transition my career to pursue this exciting field.

## Why Full-Stack Development?

Full-stack development offers the opportunity to work on both the client and server sides of web applications, allowing for a holistic understanding of the entire development process. By mastering front-end and back-end technologies, I aim to become a versatile developer capable of bringing ideas to life from conception to deployment.

## What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find a collection tutorials and projects focused on React and Django development. From beginner-friendly guides to advanced techniques, I'll be sharing my insights, tips, and best practices to help you navigate the world of full-stack development effectively.
